I created this portfolio because I want to show future employers my work and creative design skills. Allthough currently we haven't done any projects except for this one so I used placeholder images for my projects. I used american traditional for my backround images because I like american traditionals. Overall, this project was really fun and I can't wait to add actual links to my projects.
